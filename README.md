# Parallel Computing

Welcome to the **Parallel Computing** repository! This project contains implementations and examples of parallel computing techniques to optimize performance and efficiency in various computational tasks.

## 📌 About
Parallel computing is a method in which multiple calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. This repository explores different approaches to parallel computing, including:
- **Multithreading**
- **Multiprocessing**
- **Distributed computing**
- **GPU computing**

   git clone https://github.com/TanmayaPatra369/Parallel-Computing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Parallel-Computing
   ```
3. Run the example programs:
   ```sh
   python examples/example.py  # If using Python
   ```
   ```sh
   gcc -fopenmp src/example.c -o example && ./example  # If using OpenMP in C
   ```
